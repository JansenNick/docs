Welcome to the Mendix quickstart guide for building an app! These tutorials cover the essentials of Mendix development:

* [Part 1: Build a Responsive Web App](/refguide/quickstart-part1/)
* [Part 2: Add a Native Mobile App](/refguide/quickstart-part2/)

Each tutorial should take about 25 minutes to complete. 

While you can start with Part 2, we recommend you read Part 1 to understand the basics of Mendix.

When you are done, you will have mastered the basics of building and hosting apps with Mendix, and you will have your first app.

Let's get started with [Part 1](/refguide/quickstart-part1/)!
